Introduction

This README file provides an overview of our team’s project prototype on the virtual reality game that
aims to educate users on safe cycling and safe usage of PMDs in Singapore. Our product which
is known as Aegis will give the user a simulated virtual environment that resembles the roads
and terrains in Singapore. The purpose of this prototype will be to educate the user by making them aware of the different road hazards in various scenarios and the proper actions they must take to prevent accidents. 
Through a designer interface, SCTF is able to change specific game settings to re-enact different scenarios that a user might face on the roads.
